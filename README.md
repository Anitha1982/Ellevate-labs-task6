# Subqueries in SQL

This covers how to use subqueries with IN, EXISTS, and = operators.
- Use `IN` to match values from a list returned by a subquery.
- Use `EXISTS` to check if the subquery returns any rows.
- Use `=` with scalar subqueries that return a single value.
  
Examples include filtering by department, checking salary conditions, and finding top earners.
